    <p> SEAGrid Gateway has evolved from initial focus in Chemistry (GridChem) encompassing broader Science and
      Engineering Applications. In addition to the desktop client, SEAGrid provides a Web Browser based gateway access.
      The SEAGrid gateway is in active development and we welcome you to try the pre-production alpha release and provide feedback.</p>


    <p> Note: For production usage, we recommend using the GridChem Desktop client.</p>
