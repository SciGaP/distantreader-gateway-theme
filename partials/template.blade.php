        We are generating sequence data at an alarming rate! The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/">Sequence Read Archive</a> currently contains ~10 petabases of sequence data (~1016 bp) and through 2016 has grown at approximately 10 TB of sequence data per day. Weâ€™re here to help you search through that data and find meaning to your own data!
      </p>
        <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;">
        At searchsra.org we have identified the metagenomics data in the sequence read archive using the open source <a href="https://github.com/linsalrob/partie/">PARTIE</a>, and we provide both nucleotide and protein searches so that you can explore that data.

              SciGaP is a hosted service with a public API that science gateways can use to manage
              applications and workflows running on remote supercomputers, as well as other services. Gateway
              developers can thus concentrate their efforts on building their scientific communities and not
              worry about operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Science Gateway Platform as a Service (SciGaP) provides application programmer interfaces (APIs)
              to hosted generic infrastructure services that can be used by domain science communities to
              create Science Gateways.

              Apache Airavata is a software framework which is dominantly used to build Web-based science
              gateways and assist to compose, manage, execute and monitor large scale applications and
              workflows on distributed computing resources such as local clusters, supercomputers, national
              grids, academic and commercial clouds. Airavata mainly supports long running applications and
              workflows on distributed computational resources.
