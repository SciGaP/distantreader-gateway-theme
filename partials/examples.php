    Rob has searched the SRA hundreds of times for crAssphage and this figure shows the abundance of crAssphage across 10,260 metagenomes that contain it.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;" align="left">
    The genome is 97kb, and the horizontal axis shows the position in the genome.
    The vertical axis shows metagenomes, each one is a row.
    The darker the color, the more abundant crAssphage is in those metagenomes.
    There are some regions of the exemplar phage that are not present in many of the metagenomes, as shown by the whiter regions, while much of the phage genome is highly conserved.

    The boxes at the bottom show the positions of individual genes along the genome.

    In 2018 students at SDSU used the underpinnings of searchsra.org to develop independent research projects to explore metagenomes.
