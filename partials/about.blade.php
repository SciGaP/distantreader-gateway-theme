        The Distant Reader is a tool for reading.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;" align="left">
        The Distant Reader empowers you to use &amp; understand large amounts of textual information both quickly &amp; easily. For example, the Distant Reader can consume the entire issue of scholarly journal, the complete works of a given author, or the content found at the other end of an arbitrarily long list of URLs. Thus, the Distant Reader is akin to a book's table-of-contents or back-of-the-book index but at scale. It simplifies the process of identifying trends &amp; anomalies in a corpus, and then it enables you to further investigate those trends &amp; anomalies.

        <p style="font-size:18px; margin-top:20px;" align="left">
        Technically speaking, the Distant Reader is a system which locally harvests/caches content you specify. It then transforms the content into plain text, performs sets of natural language processing &amp; text mining against the text, saves the results in a number of formats, reduces the whole to a cross-platform database file, queries the database thus summarizing the collection, zips the results of the entire process into a single file, and makes the file available to you for further investigation -- "reading".

		I don't know about you, but now-a-days I can find plenty of scholarly &amp; authoritative content. My problem is not one of discovery but instead one of comprehension. How do I make sense of all the content I find? The Distant Reader is intended to address this question by making observations against a corpus and providing tools for interpreting the results. It is my hope you will find the tool as useful as I do.
