        Searching the SRA was the brainchild of <a href="https://edwards.sdsu.edu/research/">Rob Edwards</a> at <a href="https://www.sdsu.edu/">San Diego State University</a>. As a pioneer of metagenomics, Rob was frustrated that most of the DNA sequences that were publicly available were not searchable or useable, and he couldnâ€™t find crAssphage in any of them. He started by <a href="https://edwards.sdsu.edu/research/sra/">exploring the SRA</a> to find out where that phage was hiding.
